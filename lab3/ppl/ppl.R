# Simulator of a packet switched point-to-point link, with 2 scheduling
# mechanisms (fifo and strict priority), and 2 source types (both with Poisson
# arrivals but one with exponentially distributed packet sizes and the other
# with fixed packet sizes). It estimates the average packet delay, and the
# throughput of each flow.
